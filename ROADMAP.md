# Box-Box F1 Simulation Platform
## One-Page Execution Plan

---

## 🎯 Core Principle (Non-Negotiable)

**RaceState is the product. Everything else is a projection or interpretation of it.**

If a feature doesn't clearly:
- **Read** RaceState
- **Explain** RaceState  
- **Modify** RaceState through `tick()`

…it doesn't ship.

## 🧠 What We're Building

You are **NOT** building:
- ❌ An F1 game
- ❌ A stats dashboard
- ❌ An ML demo

You **ARE** building:
- ✅ **A race-reasoning engine with a visual and probabilistic interface**

## 📋 Development Phases (Anti-Gravity Approach)

> **Critical:** Each phase builds on the previous. Do NOT skip ahead. Do NOT start with real data.

---

## 🚀 PHASE A — Deterministic Race Engine ✅ COMPLETE
**⏱️ Weeks 1–3** — *Completed Feb 6, 2026*

### Goal
A full race can run **headless, replayable, and believable**.

### What to Build

#### 1. RaceState Schema (Final, Versioned)
```python
# models/race_state.py
class RaceState(BaseModel):
    """Single source of truth for the entire race"""
    
    meta: Meta = {
        "seed": int,           # For deterministic replay
        "tick": int,           # Current simulation tick
        "timestamp": int,      # Simulation time (ms)
        "laps_total": int
    }
    
    track: Track = {
        "id": str,
        "name": str,
        "length": int,         # meters
        "sectors": List[Sector],
        "weather": Weather     # rain_probability, temp, wind
    }
    
    cars: List[Car] = [
        {
            "driver": str,
            "team": str,
            "position": int,       # Current race position
            "lap": int,
            "sector": int,         # 0, 1, 2
            "lap_progress": float, # 0.0 - 1.0
            "speed": float,        # km/h
            "fuel": float,         # kg remaining
            "tire_state": {
                "compound": str,   # SOFT, MEDIUM, HARD
                "age": int,        # laps on this set
                "wear": float      # 0.0 (new) - 1.0 (dead)
            },
            "pit_stops": int,
            "status": str          # RACING, PITTED, DNF
        }
    ]
    
    events: List[Event] = []  # SC, VSC, incidents, overtakes
```

#### 2. Seeded RNG
- [x] Implement deterministic random number generator
- [x] Use seed for all randomness (weather changes, tire wear variance, incidents)
- [x] **Test:** Same seed → same race every time

#### 3. tick(state, controls) → newState
```python
def tick(current_state: RaceState, controls: Controls) -> RaceState:
    """
    Pure function that advances race by one tick.
    NO side effects. NO external API calls. NO database writes.
    """
    # Update car positions based on speed
    # Calculate tire wear
    # Apply fuel consumption
    # Check for events (SC, VSC, pit stops)
    # Resolve overtakes
    return new_state
```

- [x] Tick resolution: **100ms simulation time**
- [x] Physics calculations:
  - Speed based on tire wear, fuel load, sector type
  - Tire degradation (compound-specific curves)
  - Fuel consumption (mass impact on lap time)
- [x] Lap completion detection
- [x] Sector transitions
- [x] **Extended Physics:** DRS, ERS, Slipstream, Dirty Air, Driving Modes, Blue Flags

#### 4. Synthetic Tracks, Drivers, Weather
- [x] Create 3-5 **fake** tracks with realistic properties
  - Monaco, Monza, Spa, Silverstone — all with SVG track maps
  ```python
  TRACK_MONACO = Track(
      id="monaco_synthetic",
      length=3337,  # meters
      sectors=[
          Sector(type="SLOW", length=1112),
          Sector(type="MEDIUM", length=1112),
          Sector(type="FAST", length=1113)
      ],
      weather=Weather(rain_prob=0.1, temp=25)
  )
  ```
- [x] Create **synthetic** driver profiles (20 drivers, skill levels 0.85–0.99, track affinity)
- [x] Weather system (probability-based rain, affects grip, drifts over time)

#### 5. Event System
- [x] Safety Car (SC) triggers:
  - Random incidents (probability-based)
  - Manual trigger via controls
  - Car bunching algorithm
- [x] Virtual Safety Car (VSC):
  - Speed limit enforcement (40% reduction)
  - Delta time calculations
- [x] Pit stops:
  - Time loss calculation (stationary + in/out laps)
  - Tire strategy logic (AI + Team Principal commands)
- [x] DNFs (mechanical failures, crashes)
- [x] **Lap time tracking** (last lap, best lap, fastest lap detection)

#### 6. CLI Output
```bash
$ python -m app.simulation.run --seed=42 --laps=53

Lap 1: VER P1 | HAM P2 | LEC P3
Lap 18: SAFETY CAR deployed
Lap 19: PIT - HAM, LEC (MEDIUM → HARD)
Lap 23: SAFETY CAR ending
Lap 53: FINISHED
  1. VER +0.000s
  2. HAM +3.214s
  3. LEC +8.901s
```

### Deliverable
```bash
$ run_race(seed=42)
# Outputs deterministic race results
# Can replay with same seed → same outcome
```

### Definition of Done
✅ Same seed → same race — **VERIFIED** (test_determinism.py)  
✅ No UI required — **VERIFIED** (CLI runner works headless)  
✅ ML completely absent — **VERIFIED** (ML added in Phase C only)  
✅ You trust the output — **VERIFIED** (43 tests pass, physics verified)  

### 🚫 DO NOT BUILD
- ❌ UI
- ❌ ML predictions
- ❌ FastF1 integration
- ❌ TimescaleDB
- ❌ Real race data

---

## 🎮 PHASE B — Simulation Viewer ✅ COMPLETE
**⏱️ Weeks 4–5** — *Completed Feb 9, 2026*

#### 4. Race State Modifiers
- [x] Component: `RaceControls.jsx`
  - Deploy Safety Car button
  - Deploy VSC button

#### 5. Position Tower
- [x] Component: `PositionTower.jsx`
  - Real-time standings
  - Gap to leader
  - Gap to car ahead
  - Pit stop indicator

---

## 🧠 PHASE C — ML Interpreter 🔄 IN PROGRESS
**⏱️ Weeks 6–7** — *Data pipeline complete, training done, API integrated*

### Goal
**Predictions that feel earned, not magical.**

### What to Build

#### 1. ML Reads RaceState Snapshots
- [x] Feature extraction from RaceState (`feature_extractor.py`):
  ```python
  def extract_features(state: RaceState) -> pd.DataFrame:
      # Now uses refactored Car sub-models
      for car in state.cars:
          features.append({
              "driver": car.identity.driver,
              "position": car.timing.position,
              "tire_wear": car.telemetry.tire_state.wear,
              "sc_active": state.race_control == RaceControl.SAFETY_CAR,
              ...
          })
  ```

#### 2. Model Training (Synthetic Data Only)
- [x] Generate 1000+ synthetic races with different seeds (`generate_training_data.py`)
- [x] Extract snapshots at key moments:
  - Every 50 ticks (~5 seconds sim time)
  - Labeled with final positions
- [x] Train classification models:
  - **Win probability** (binary) — `win_model.joblib`
  - **Podium probability** (top 3 finish) — `podium_model.joblib`
  - **Points probability** (top 10 finish)

#### 3. Model Architecture
```python
class RacePredictionModel:
    def __init__(self):
        self.win_model = RandomForestClassifier()
        self.podium_model = RandomForestClassifier()
        
    def predict(self, state: RaceState) -> Predictions:
        features = extract_features(state)
        
        win_probs = self.win_model.predict_proba(features)
        podium_probs = self.podium_model.predict_proba(features)
        
        # Calculate confidence based on lap progress
        confidence = min(0.95, state.meta.tick / total_ticks)
        
        return Predictions(
            win_prob=dict(zip(drivers, win_probs)),
            podium_prob=dict(zip(drivers, podium_probs)),
            confidence=confidence,
            lap=state.cars[0].lap
        )
```

#### 4. Outputs
```json
{
  "lap": 32,
  "win_prob": {
    "VER": 0.41,
    "HAM": 0.27,
    "LEC": 0.18,
    "SAI": 0.08,
    "...": 0.06
  },
  "podium_prob": {
    "VER": 0.89,
    "HAM": 0.72,
    "LEC": 0.58,
    "...": "..."
  },
  "confidence": 0.62
}
```

#### 5. API Endpoints
- [x] `POST /api/ml/predict` - Get predictions for current state
- [ ] `GET /api/ml/confidence-curve/{simulation_id}` - Confidence over time
- [ ] `POST /api/ml/retrain` - Re-train on new synthetic races

#### 6. UI Components
- [x] Component: `PredictionPanel.jsx`
  - Win probability bars (top 5 drivers)
  - Podium probability
  - Confidence score visualization
- [ ] Live updates as race progresses
- [ ] Probability changes highlighted

### Deliverable
```json
{
  "lap": 32,
  "winProb": { "VER": 0.41, "HAM": 0.27 },
  "confidence": 0.62
}
```

### Definition of Done
✅ Probabilities change **because** race changes  
✅ Confidence grows as race stabilizes  
✅ You can explain every spike  
✅ ML **never** writes to RaceState  

### 🚫 DO NOT BUILD
- ❌ Predictions based on real F1 data
- ❌ Real-time race predictions (that comes in Phase D)

---

## 📊 PHASE D — Reality Injection
**⏱️ Weeks 8–10**

### Goal
**Connect the engine to real F1.** FastF1 answers: "How close are we to reality?"

### What to Build

- [ ] Service: `FastF1DataCollector`
  ```python
  class FastF1DataCollector:
      def fetch_race(self, season: int, round: int) -> RaceData:
          """Download race data from FastF1"""
          session = fastf1.get_session(season, round, 'R')
          session.load()
          return RaceData(
              laps=session.laps,
              telemetry=session.telemetry,
              weather=session.weather_data,
              results=session.results
          )
  ```
- [ ] Ingest historical races (2018-2024)
- [ ] Store in PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB extension

#### 2. Map Real Races → RaceState Snapshots
- [ ] Service: `RaceStateMapper`
  ```python
  def map_real_race_to_states(race_data: RaceData) -> List[RaceState]:
      """
      Convert real F1 race into series of RaceState snapshots
      """
      states = []
      for lap in race_data.laps:
          state = RaceState(
              meta=Meta(seed=0, tick=lap.lap_number * 1000, ...),
              cars=[
                  Car(
                      driver=driver.abbreviation,
                      position=driver.position,
                      lap=lap.lap_number,
                      tire_state=TireState(compound=driver.compound, ...),
                      ...
                  )
                  for driver in lap.drivers
              ],
              ...
          )
          states.append(state)
      return states
  ```

#### 3. TimescaleDB for Telemetry
```sql
-- Telemetry hypertable (optimized for time-series)
CREATE TABLE telemetry (
    time TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    race_id INTEGER,
    driver_id INTEGER,
    speed DECIMAL,
    throttle DECIMAL,
    brake BOOLEAN,
    gear INTEGER,
    rpm INTEGER,
    drs BOOLEAN
);

SELECT create_hypertable('telemetry', 'time');
```

#### 4. Calibration Tools
- [ ] Component: `SimVsRealityComparison.tsx`
  - Side-by-side: Sim race vs Real race
  - Position changes comparison
  - Lap time delta analysis
  - Tire strategy comparison
- [ ] Identify differences:
  - Where does sim diverge?
  - Which parameters need tuning?

#### 5. Parameter Adjustment (NOT Architecture Change)
```python
# Adjust physics parameters to match reality
TIRE_DEGRADATION_COEFFICIENTS = {
    "SOFT": 0.012,   # Adjusted from 0.010
    "MEDIUM": 0.008, # Adjusted from 0.007
    "HARD": 0.005
}

FUEL_EFFECT_ON_LAPTIME = 0.035  # seconds per kg
```

#### 6. ML Re-training with Real Context
- [ ] Train models on **both**:
  - Synthetic race snapshots
  - Real race snapshots
- [ ] Improve metrics:
  - Brier score (calibration)
  - Log loss
  - Prediction convergence speed

### Deliverable
- Replay real races through your engine
- Compare predicted vs actual outcomes
- Adjust parameters, not architecture

### Definition of Done
✅ Engine survives messy real data  
✅ You know where sim ≠ reality  
✅ ML improves with real context  
✅ Core logic **unchanged**

### Definition of Done
✅ Someone else can use it without you  
✅ Demo tells a clear story  
✅ Bugs are explainable, not mysterious  

---

## 🎯 MVP Cut Line (Very Important)

**If you stop after Phase C, you already have:**
- ✅ A unique simulation engine
- ✅ Explainable ML
- ✅ A killer portfolio project

**Everything after that is leverage, not survival.**

---

## 📊 Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Phase |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Determinism** | Same seed → same race | A |
| **Simulation Speed** | 1 race in <60 seconds | A |
| **UI Responsiveness** | <16ms frame time | B |
| **ML Confidence** | >0.8 by lap 40 | C |
| **Prediction Accuracy** | Brier score <0.25 | D |
| **API Response Time** | <200ms (95th percentile) | E |
| **Test Coverage** | >80% | E |

---

## 🧪 Daily Sanity Check

Ask yourself every day:

1. ❓ Can I **replay** this?
2. ❓ Can I **explain** this?
3. ❓ Did UI or ML secretly **mutate state**?
4. ❓ Did I add **realism before correctness**?

If answers are good → keep going.  
If any answer is no → backtrack.

---

## 🚫 What NOT to Do

| Don't | Why | Do This Instead |
|-------|-----|-----------------|
| Start with FastF1 | Real data is messy and distracting | Build synthetic engine first |
| Build UI and logic together | Coupling kills testability | Engine headless, UI reads state |
| Let ML write to RaceState | Breaks determinism | ML only reads and interprets |
| Add features too early | Scope creep kills projects | Follow phases strictly |
| Optimize prematurely | Wastes time | Make it work, then make it fast |

## 🏁 Final Framing

> **If your synthetic race engine is perfect, reality can be layered on.**  
> **If your foundation is real-data chaos, you'll never stabilize the system.**

This is **not** a side project.  
This is **startup + portfolio-quality engineering**.

Build it right. Build it deterministic. Build it explainable.

## 🏗️ Architecture Refactor (Feb 12, 2026)

A senior-level design review led to a structural refactoring of the core models:

### Car Model Decomposition
The monolithic `Car` model was split into 5 focused sub-models:
| Sub-model | Fields | Purpose |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| `CarIdentity` | `driver`, `team` | Immutable identity |
| `CarTelemetry` | `speed`, `fuel`, `lap_progress`, `tire_state` | Real-time sensor data |
| `CarSystems` | `drs_active`, `ers_battery`, `ers_deployed` | Electronic systems |
| `CarStrategy` | `driving_mode`, `active_command` | Strategy decisions |
| `CarTiming` | `position`, `lap`, `sector`, gaps, lap times | Timing & classification |

### RaceControl Enum
Replaced 3 boolean flags with a single enum for mutually exclusive states:
`GREEN | YELLOW | VSC | SAFETY_CAR | RED_FLAG`

### Schema Version
Added `schema_version: int` to `RaceState` for future persistence/replay compatibility.

### Files Updated (11 total)
`race_state.py`, `data.py`, `engine.py`, `data_logger.py`, `run.py`, `run_race.py`, `main.py`, `feature_extractor.py`, `generate_training_data.py`, `test_events.py`, `test_determinism.py`

**All 43 tests pass after refactor.**

---

## 🖥️ UI Overhaul: Intelligence Console (Feb 21, 2026)

Replaced the expensive visual track rendering with rigorous analytical panels to focus entirely on motorsport intelligence and Expected Value (EV).

### Visual Layers Removed
- `TrackMap.jsx` - Replaced by pure data layouts.

### Analytical Features Added
- **Probability Evolution (`ProbabilityGraph.jsx`)**: Live Recharts graph tracking driver win probability vectors.
- **Expected Value Tree (`StrategyTree.jsx`)**: Visual decision tree determining if a pit stop has positive/negative positional EV under current conditions.
- **Impact Sensitivity (`SensitivityAnalysis.jsx`)**: At-a-glance view of which simulated variables are moving predictions the most.
- **Chaos Meter (`VolatilityIndex.jsx`)**: A 0-100 volatility index indicating the stability or strategic unpredictability of the race.
- **Scenario Injector (`ScenarioControls.jsx`)**: Top-level macro controls to instantly modify conditions and watch the prediction engine react.

## 🔄 Next Steps

1. **Wire Scenario Controls to Engine:** Connect the new `ScenarioControls.jsx` inputs (Aggression, SC Probability, Tire Deg multipliers) to backend WebSocket commands so they dynamically mutate the `RaceState`.
2. **Complete Phase D (Reality Injection):** 
   - Build `FastF1DataCollector` to start ingesting historical session telemetry.
   - Build `RaceStateMapper` to convert messy FastF1 reality into clean `RaceState` snapshots that our engine understands.
3. **Simulation vs Reality Polish:** Build the visual comparison tools (`SimVsRealityComparison.jsx`) so we can quantify exactly where our simulation engine diverges from actual F1 history.

> **Remember:** You're building a **race-reasoning engine**, not a dashboard. Every decision should serve RaceState correctness first.
